# Nginx PageSpeed Backup

This directory contains a backup of all PageSpeed related files that were removed from the main project.

The Nginx PageSpeed module was removed because it is no longer being actively developed by Google or the community.

## Contents

- Controllers: Original controller scripts from `/menu/controller/pagespeed/`
- Templates: Original template files from `/menu/template/ngx_pagespeed/`

These files are kept for reference purposes only and should not be restored unless you specifically need this functionality and are aware that it's no longer maintained or updated.

Date of removal: June 19, 2025
